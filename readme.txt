A custom post types and taxonomies plugin

== Description ==

<h2><strong>Instant Post Types by Plugins Corner</strong></h2>

We've started our journey with our first product called Instant Post Types which will allow you to add a custom post type or a taxonomy from any screen of the admin area so you won't have your flow interrupted. The plugin allows you to build Unlimited Custom Post Types and Unlimited Custom Taxonomies from the get go.

You can also link your Custom Taxonomies to existing post types or custom post types under your website

<h2><strong>Check us out</strong></h2>

Our webiste is still under construction at the moment but we're planning big things. Give us a visit at <a target="_blank" href="https://pluginscorner.com/">https://pluginscorner.com</a> and leave us a message with what you think about our plugin.

<h2><strong>What's next?</strong></h2>

We're trying to update the plugin as much as possible in  order to ofer new an exciting features, as well as fixing any bugs. In our next versions we're going to be adding:

1. <strong>Custom fields</strong> - While this is still a beta version we would like to also add the possibility of creating and managing custom fields as simple as you do with custom post types and custom taxonomies. The custom fields can be added to the theme template by functions or shortcodes
2. <strong>A PRO version</strong> - The pro version of the plugin will have an integration with the Guttenberg editor and Elementor in order to make everything even easier. We will most probably create our own live editor with this version as well. Another pro feature will be the possibility of adding more complex fields and possibly even simpler ways of creating and managing your custom post types and custom taxonomies. This version will also provide better support via a section within the wordpress admin area so you will never have to leave the comfort of wordpress in order to get help.
3. <strong>Other plugins</strong> - One of our ideas is to also build a <strong>membership plugin</strong>. While we don't really know at the moment what to build next maybe you can help us out. Leave us a message at <a href="mailto:office@pluginscorner.com">office@pluginscorner.com</a> and we promise we're going to listen to every piece of feedback.
